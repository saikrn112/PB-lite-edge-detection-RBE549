******* Oriented Derivative of Gaussian (DoG) filter ********

Convolution ----------------
-----------
convoluted image = Sum( H(i)F(c - i) ) where i : 0 -> N
                        H(x) -- weighted matrix - gaussian etc
                        F(x) -- actual image

cross correlated image = Sum( H(i)F(c + i) ) where i : 0 -> N
                        H(x) -- weighted matrix - gaussian etc
                        F(x) -- actual image
    difference between cross correlation and convolution is a flip sign in the function F
    It wouldnt matter for symmetric filters but matters for asymmetric filters
